$$
\mathbb{P}\left(\mathcal{T}_{-t} \mid  L_1,\cdots,L_S;~ \mathcal{T}_1 ,\cdots,\mathcal{T}_S;~ M \right) = \sum_{A_{1},\cdots, A_{S}}   \mathbb{P}(\mathcal{T}_{-t} \mid A_{1},\cdots, A_{S};~ M)  \prod_s  \mathbb{P}(A_{s} \mid  L_s, \mathcal{T}_s ) 
$$

$$
\mathbb{P}\left(\mathcal{T}_{-t} \mid  L_1,\cdots,L_S;~ \mathcal{T}_1 ,\cdots,\mathcal{T}_S;~ M \right) \approx \prod_{s=0}^{S-1}\prod_{r=s+1}^{S}\mathbb{P}\left(C \mid L_s,L_r;~ \mathcal{T}_s, \mathcal{T}_r;~ M \right)
$$

where

$$
\mathbb{P}\left(C \mid L_s,L_r;~ \mathcal{T}_s, \mathcal{T}_r;~ M \right) = \sum_{i \in D}\sum_{j \in D}\mathbb{P}\left(A_s=i \mid L_s,\mathcal{T}_s \right) \mathbb{P}\left(A_r=j \mid L_r,\mathcal{T}_r \right)\mathbb{P}\left(C \mid i,j,M \right)
$$

Breaking down the above equation into its three probabilities, the first two are the probability that the ancestor is found in a specified deme ($i$ or $j$) under Brownian motion. The last term is the probability of the coalescent time of those ancestors ($C$) given that they start in specific demes and there is a constant migration rate between the demes ($M$). We loop over all of the combinations of demes for the pair to calculate the overall probability of the coalescent time. Here, there is an arbitrary number of demes ($D$) though we will at least start with the two deme scenario, where $D = (0, 1)$. The number of deme combinations can be reduced in scenarios with symmetric migration -- which we have here but are not taking advantage of -- or when the deme sizes are the same. The equation two above then combines all of the pairwise probabilities to approximate the probability of the tree above time $t$ altogether. 

To compute $\mathbb{P}\left(C \mid i,j,M \right)$,
